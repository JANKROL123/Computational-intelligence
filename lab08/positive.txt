A modern clean good value hotel in a great position next to the Golden Gate in 
Old Town. I went with 7 mates, we all had a double room each. The reception 
staff were friendly professional and spoke excellent English. Breakfast is buffet 
style and served in the adjoining bar/restaurant and was excellent value with 
plenty of choice. Bars, clubs, restaurants and cultural attractions are all within 
a stroll. Would def recommend.
